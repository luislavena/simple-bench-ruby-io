h1. simple-bench-ruby-io

The purpose of this repository is mimic the basic startup issues Ruby suffers
on Windows, while not trying to figure out all the pieces of working with a
Rails application.

h2. What is inside

* boot.rb - contains a simple loading mechanism for loading Isolate
* app.rb - contains the basic startup/setup required for a simple application

h2. Requirements

* Rake
* Isolate 3.1 (@gem install isolate --pre@)
* "ImDisk":http://www.ltr-data.se/opencode.html/#ImDisk
* "w32time":https://github.com/larsch/w32time (renamed as timer)

h3. Why is using ABC and not XYZ

Not going to explain all the details, but the rationale is the following:

h4. Isolate versus Bundler

Needed something that install gems inside the RAMDisk (ImDisk) and
keep the Ruby installation clean. Also need something small in code that do not
affect a lot runtime operations (it also play nice with binary gems).

h4. DataMapper versus ActiveRecord

ActiveRecord depends on ActiveSupport and delays a lot of require functionality.
I'm trying to simulate a _simple_ case first, then will worry about Rails.
